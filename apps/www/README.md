    ```
2. Fill in the required environment variables in the `.env` file.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install

```

### Step 3: Run the Development Server
